Whereas the Argument is typically recognized as satirizing insincere Christian belief, my literary-historical approach focuses on Swift\u2019s references to public opinion and the speaker\u2019s claim that the Gospel \u201cis generally antiquated and exploded.\u201d For Swift, public opinion has a distorting effect on communication, and yet he participates in the public sphere nevertheless. This performative contradiction provides an instructive addition to Christian debates concerning the moral dangers of assimilation and taking on a role.","True stories of Mongolian nomadic Christian families how they came to faith in Christ, how they relate to God, and what their callings are.","","Physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) is considered by many to have been as important\nto physics as Newton and Einstein, especially for his work on electricity and magnetism\nand for being the first director of the Cavendish Laboratory. His technical achievements are\nsignificant, but he also offers us a model of the qualities of physics education in a Christian\nliberal arts environment. This work explores his writings and discusses some of his various\nexperiences, such as his broad education at the University of Edinburgh and participation\nin elite intellectual discussion societies, which developed and demonstrated his ability to\nthink broadly. In some instances, he shared about his faith in God and how it informed his\nperspectives. Furthermore, in the inaugural lectures he gave for the three professorships he\nheld over his lifetime, he shared his views on the role that the study of physics can play in\npersonal formation. This paper suggests that his personal and professional examples may be\ncritical qualities to be emulated in today's Christian liberal arts physics programs, as higher\neducation undergoes significant transition.","","","","","Religious faith has been a historical catalyst for public education even prior to the founding of the United States. Over the last 50 years, courts in the United States have endeavored to clarify the role of religion in public education calling into question the role of religion in open forums such as schools. Is the religious faith of a teacher a liability or an asset? Does religion, particularly Christian faith, help or hinder a teacher in the public school classroom? These questions are essential to answer in the rapidly changing public school environment. Christian liberal arts teacher preparation programs can combine the strengths of traditional teacher preparation programs and the liberal arts with religious faith to serve the holistic needs of students.","","This article investigates the ideological underpinnings of these plans, and explores the irony of how the proposals and their governance arrangement are a disjuncture with Oecusse as a historically important place. It concludes with observations on this project's place in the national development context, and the likely costs and impacts\nof development for the Oecusse population.","","","","","","Until now there has been no effort to integrate this framework with a Christian understanding of psychopathology. The essays in this volume break new ground by providing Christian mental health professionals with a theoretically and empirically sound basis for working with children, adolescents and families.

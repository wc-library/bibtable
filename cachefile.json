This work deals with and explains a great branch of Muhammadan literature which stands beside the Quaran as a source of Muslim belief and practice. It was odd that no other books were published in the English language that discussed the traditions of Islam, because the everyday life of Muslims throughout the world is governed and directed by these traditions. Contents: evolution of Hadith; Umayyad Period; Abbasid Period; criticism of Hadith by Muslims; selections from Hadith; borrowing from Christian documents and tradition; some aspects of the Prophet Muhammad in tradition; bibliography; glossary of more common technical terms used in the Hadith literature.","","","","\"Gathers together the essential texts and documents that trace the origin, history, and evolution of the ideas of Al Qaeda founders Ayman al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden\"--Provided by publisher","","","Alfred Guillaume's authoritative translation of the Sira of Ibn Ishaq presents in English the complete history of the life of Prophet Muhammad.

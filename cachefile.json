magisterial book is an analysis of the course of Western intellectual history between A.D. 400 and 1400. The book is arranged in two parts: the first surveys the comparative modes of thought and varying success of Byzantine, Latin-Christian, and Muslim cultures, and the second takes the reader from the eleventh-century revival of learning to the high Middle Ages and beyond, the period in which the vibrancy of Western intellectual culture enabled it to stamp its imprint well beyond the frontiers of Christendom.Marcia Colish argues that the foundations of the Western intellectual tradition were laid in the Middle Ages and not, as is commonly held, in the Judeo-Christian or classical periods. She contends that Western medieval thinkers produced a set of tolerances, tastes, concerns, and sensibilities that made the Middle Ages unlike other chapters of the Western intellectual experience. She provides astute descriptions of the vernacular and oral culture of each country of Europe; explores the nature of medieval culture and its transmission; profiles seminal thinkers (Augustine, Anselm, Gregory the Great, Aquinas, Ockham); studies heresy from Manichaeism to Huss and Wycliffe; and investigates the influence of Arab and Jewish writing on scholasticism and the resurrection of Greek studies. Colish concludes with an assessment of the modes of medieval thought that ended with the period and those that remained as bases for later ages of European intellectual history.This book inaugurates an important new series that provides a chronological account of intellectual life and the development of ideas in Western Europe from the medieval period to the present.","","","","The problem of evangelicalism is the question of why it has remained such a popular, potent force in American life throughout the twentieth century. This study traces the vitality of evangelicalism back to the structure and ethos of fundamentalist institutions by examining Wheaton College--the movement's most prominent liberal arts college and the hub of a large network of other independent, special purpose religious organizations.\nWheaton was very much a two-cultures institution, embodying characteristics of and mediating between a popular religious movement and the secular world of higher education. The college's history between 1919 and 1965 shows that the nature of fundamentalists' institutional networks required a good deal of mutual cooperation. It also shows that the movement was quite at home with the forms and ideas of American popular culture. In Wheaton's case, the college adopted the culture's prevailing ideas about liberal arts education nearly whole cloth--purposes, structure, curriculum, accreditation, admissions, student culture, and even a good measure of faculty culture--without yielding a fraction of its full-bodied, pre-modern supernaturalism. This suggests that fundamentalism's enduring popular success stems not from any tendency to separate itself from its host culture, nor from any tendency to resist change, but from the movement's ready willingness to adapt its pre-modern supernaturalistic Christianity to the shifting forms of modern popular culture.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This essay, utilizing the \u201ckaleidoscope\u201d image of historian Timothy Smith, reflects on issues affecting evangelical identity and boundaries in the major professional association for Christian higher education, the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU). Since the CCCU was birthed by a smaller organization, the Christian College Consortium, attention is given to how evangelical boundaries were understood by the parent group. The paper then shows how the CCCU stretched those boundaries in several directions as membership grew. Over a period of 25-plus years, the CCCU cultivated a marked denominational pluralism along with a cooperative evangelical ecumenism. This essay explores these developments in terms of membership criteria including affiliate status, doctrinal standards, the emphasis on the integration of faith and learning, and official statements and limitations of the CCCU's approach to evangelical boundaries, suggesting that the CCCU look at developing more definitive doctrinal anchors for its mission statement and membership criteria.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"The humanities disciplines don't seem to be dying out, but they do feel dislocated. They are institutionally insecure because they appear to have lost their philosophical roots. The question this paper attempts to address is exactly what those roots were in the first place.\"","","","","","\"This timely look at the state of Christian higher education in America contains descriptive, historical narratives that explore how fourteen Christian colleges and universities are successfully integrating faith and learning on their campuses despite the challenges posed by the increasingly pluralistic nature of modern culture. Written by respected representatives from seven major faith traditions - Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Reformed, Mennonite, Evangelical, Wesleyan\/Holiness, and Baptist\/Restorationist - these narratives are also preceded by introductory essays that define the worldview and theological heritage of each given tradition and ask what that tradition can contribute to the task of higher education.\"--BOOK JACKET.","The authors offer a new definition and analysis of Christian scholarship that respects the insights of different Christian traditions (e.g., Catholic, Lutheran, Anabaptist, Wesleyan, Pentecostal) and that applies to the arts and to professional studies as much as it does to the humanities and the natural and social sciences. The book itself is organized as a conversation. Five chapters by the Jacobsens alternate with four contributed essays that sharpen, illustrate, or complicate the material in the preceding chapters. --from publisher description","","","","","","\"Faith is not just meant for church on Sunday,\" contends Mark Cosgrove. \"Faith and learning are interwoven with each other for the full functioning of the human mind.\" A book that details this interconnection between faith and learning, Foundations of Christian Thought encourages readers to view the Christian faith and worldview as relevant to everything they read, study, and consider. In part 1, Cosgrove explores the relationship between faith and learning and how an underlying worldview can influence one's beliefs. Part 2 describes and tests five major worldviews competing with Christian theism, including naturalism, secular humanism, atheistic existentialism, pantheism, and the New Age movement. The last part probes the Christian worldview in more detail by analyzing the challenges it faces and how it is lived out day-to-day. An educator on the college campus for thirty years, Cosgrove testifies to how well the Christian worldview relates with the current needs and ideas in American culture. Through Foundations of Christian Thought, high school and college students will begin to see how the Christian worldview is relevant to what they are studying in the classroom and the decisions they make. Readers in the workforce and elsewhere will learn to relate their faith to modern worldviews in our culture.","","","This study explores the emergence and fulfillment of a saga at Wheaton College, the most academically renowned and selective of the evangelical Christian colleges. Burton Clark identified a powerful, affective commitment by members to their organization as a key to distinctiveness at three liberal arts colleges: Swarthmore, Antioch, and Reed. How do sagas emerge and become fulfilled in institutions embracing a conservative, biblical worldview?\nData were collected from three schools (Wheaton, Seattle Pacific and Westmont). The Wheaton case alone was written up because of the powerful saga that prevailed at that college. A combination of data collection strategies were used: participant observation, archival research, and interviews. The case study method combines a historical approach with the data gathered on site for a rich overview of Wheaton College from its founding in 1860 to the 1980's.\nWheaton's history is a vibrant and dynamic account of an institution with a distinct purpose and a strong sense of destiny. From the outset, Wheaton College became identified as an institution willing to stand alone, to pursue a course consistent with the theologically orthodox principles to which the school was initially dedicated. The founder and his son laid the foundations of a mission and a sense of purpose for the College which galvanized faculty, trustees, students and alumni into a faithful and committed group of followers. This institutional cohesion and mission, reinforced by a strong association with the fundamentalist movement in the early decades of the twentieth century, consolidated the College's orthodox evangelical Christian identity for which it is known today.\nThe confrontations of the late 1960's that swept American college campuses, the questioning of authority driving many of the protests, and the quest for new direction, purpose and meaning in higher education did not leave Wheaton unaffected. By 1967, the unity of purpose of a previous era had given way to a fragile synthesis of the traditional values challenged by a growing desire among faculty in particular for recognition in the greater academic community. Initial resistance to the values of secular academia has, in recent years, given way to an increasing desire, commensurate with the changing values and priorities of today's evangelicals, to belong and be recognized as a bona fide liberal arts college on a par with Oberlin and Amherst.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Problem. Research is lacking on the many ways the integration of faith and learning is accomplished by teachers. The purpose of this study was to develop a model of the process by which teachers integrate faith and learning in the formal curriculum. The model was validated by investigating to what extent the integration of faith and learning was deliberately accomplished by teachers in six Seventh-day Adventist secondary schools located in three South American countries.\nMethod. A multi-method approach involving questionnaire, interviews, and document analysis was used in order to study the process teachers experience in implementing integration of faith and learning in their classes. Triangulation occurred as observation from one source was cross-validated with observation from other sources.\nResults. The findings of this study support the notion of a stage model of implementation in which teachers find themselves in a continuum from no-interest, no-use, to dynamic collaboration.\nConclusions. (1) Teachers integrate faith in the formal curriculum in different stages of implementation. (2) Factors such as theoretical knowledge of integration of faith and learning, its implementation strategies, interest, concerns, and difficulty of the subject influence the degree of teacher implementation. (3) Student involvement in the integration of faith and learning process is an essential but frequently overlooked ingredient in the implementation process. (4) Support from the school administration and the parochial educational system provide direction and incentive for teacher implementation. (5) National, social, and cultural forces, along with the religious background of students and teachers, all directly or indirectly influence teacher implementation.","Although the mission statements of most member schools of the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities include a focus on the importance of the integration of faith and learning, the rhetoric often far outweighs the reality. An examination of the history of this concept, which is inexorably entwined with the history of American higher education in general, reveals its complexity and ambiguity. A plethora of authors have addressed the issue from a number of perspectives---philosophical, theological, theoretical, denominational, and practical. Very few, however, have described the personal experiences of professors in evangelical Christian liberal arts colleges and universities. The purpose of this study was to create a portrait of professors at Wheaton College, an evangelical liberal arts college, who exemplify the integration of faith and learning, in order to better understand such integration. Using portraiture, a qualitative research methodology developed by Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot that relies primarily upon in-depth interviews, the researcher provided a meaningful interpretive narrative that drew upon the voices, authority, and wisdom of these exemplary professors. Themes that emerged from the analysis of interview transcripts, observation field notes, and documents written by seven professors at Wheaton College were identified and analyzed. Implications for the administration and faculty of Christian liberal arts institutions were discussed, and suggestions for future research were made.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Much of the current library literature assumes that professional library service is necessarily neutral-detached from the librarian's philosophical or religious views. By contrast, contributors to this collection assert that librarianship is best practiced as an outworking of spiritual conviction. Accordingly, they discuss principles for integrating Christian faith and librarianship within various contexts, and reflect on professional issues from biblical and theological perspectives. This text will prove beneficial to Christians working in all types of libraries, whether religious or secular. This compilation of 16 essays is divided into two main parts, the first on theory and the second on practice. The first part includes chapters such as A Rationale for Integrating Christian Faith and Librarianship, The Master We Serve: The Call of the Christian Librarian to the Secular Workplace; and The Impact of the Christian Faith on Library Service. Chapters in the second part include Library Encounters Culture, A Christian Approach to Intellectual Freedom in Libraries and Keeping Sunday Special in the Contemporary Workplace Culture. Contributors include William Fraher Abernathy, Rod Badams, Donald G. Davis, Jr., John Allen Delivuk, Kenneth D. Gill, Graham Hedges, D. Elizabeth Irish, James R. Johnson, Roger W. Phillips, Gregory A. Smith, Stanford Terhune, John B. Trotti, John Mark Tucker and Geoff Warren.","","","","This literature review presents an overview of Christian higher education in the United States with particular attention to philosophical trends and their influence on institutions of Christian origin. This literature review is situated in the context of the discussion of the need, or lack thereof, for helping students integrate their faith with the learning they acquire in colleges and universities.","","",""],"children":[2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0],"parentItem":{"2":"HV8T6WB3","4":"VHN2FWHC","7":"NUGR6GT3","10":"MJET5Q7H","11":"5DMMWMN8","13":"U8JGEU3B","14":"WG285AEK","15":"8GJVKQ4F","16":"KQF23B7V","17":"KQF23B7V","25":"SVMPC9DX","26":"TGW45G5C","30":"AWF3558T","32":"WDNZDQAS","33":"RCVMTC2B","38":"PNKCWZQ3","39":"4ZJB5AZ5","40":"AQAUXSPE","41":"N4CZ5RJ3","42":"W46MZWMB","43":"RJ2GMAF9","51":"D796WUH9","53":"UVNT4I38","54":"GWCQ8JFA","58":"6NNXGRIX","62":"S4E324V9","64":"XGFPXES2","65":"6NNXGRIX","67":"5E7J3IFR","78":"EPDWDVPV","79":"3N6RZIRU","80":"P5PSV6HS","81":"P5PSV6HS","82":"P5PSV6HS","83":"392ZXXFG","84":"NTBZK5IH","85":"6W9TW7TP","89":"97HN2D4X","90":"97HN2D4X","91":"NIESKSK2","92":"IATT8HRZ","93":"4CAWTHNZ","95":"9F3M6J5E","98":"6VV7GFRQ","0":"7RU54IG4","5":"NTB3G43G","8":"392ZXXFG","19":"2M9MESH3","20":"VTPN6NTF","24":"5SEAB4ZA","28":"AS3CRVRI","29":"BGR75H33","36":"W5K275RK","47":"FR9CV8HJ","48":"H7TUP4KD","57":"ZZFZZFZI","59":"S4E324V9","70":"JE8TMAWX","73":"UZDE6ATQ","75":"G3PJFJ5E","76":"NJ2UMAXR","77":"8PMXA5ET","96":"DZG2MGMP","97":"7N634T9Z","99":"6U8ZKHBC","1":"EPDWDVPV","3":"HV8T6WB3","6":"42EABQ36","12":"97HN2D4X","18":"FA3GVNZ9","21":"4JFX774H","27":"SFJ22K3D","44":"KRHUXRTG","45":"MMUX4WJ3","46":"TQ95N2PM","52":"UVNT4I38","60":"9W63ENXS","61":"XGFPXES2","68":"XUZCXFAI","31":"TTAUVSM4","34":"WN4PQUQP","35":"SKVVZDJS","37":"S3FBCEHA","50":"J9NB38KE","55":"IUFXZ3MG","56":"KQ8E43FR","66":"V59MJQZN","72":"45ZZ2SIJ","74":"G3PJFJ5E","86":"H7TUP4KD","87":"JPTM7ZH8","88":"DZG2MGMP","22":"XBFE8SKH","23":"3FGJB877","63":"9W63ENXS","69":"JE8TMAWX","71":"JPTM7ZH8","94":"9F3M6J5E","9":"V6SKPS9M","49":"D796WUH9"}}

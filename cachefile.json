Guide explores the origins and development of the concept of faith-learning integration and provides an extensive bibliography of works dealing with various aspects of faith and learning.","","","","","","","","The purpose of this study was to analyze whether there is a difference between Christian and secular university graduates and their practice faith-learning integration in the classroom. Does Christian school faith-learning integration practice make a difference between one educational institution and another? To what extent do current teachers carry out the synthesis of Christian thought within their content areas and does the type of university from which they graduated make a difference?\nThe dissertation investigates the biblical, theological, and historical bases for faith-learning integration. Pedagogical, psychological, and leadership development is examined for the influence of each on the subject. Christian higher education philosophy and practice of faith-learning integration is evaluated.\nThe research methodology utilized refashioned survey and demographic instruments originally developed by Raquel Bouvet de Komiejczuk in her 1994 dissertation. ACSI teachers in 6th through 12th grades in the Mid-America region were asked four research questions concerning their knowledge, equipping, ability, and intentionality with faith-learning integration in their current Christian school classrooms.\nThe study concluded that Christian university graduates are better prepared in their knowledge and equipping of faith-learning integration. A shift in significance is demonstrated, however, when abilities to do faith-learning integration are identified. Intentionality between the two groups shows no statistical difference. Ultimately, the mediating question of administrative support of faith-learning integration in the Christian school matters more than university attendance.\nKEY WORDS: faith, learning, integration, faith-learning integration, Christian university, secular university, Christian higher education, Christian school education, ACSI, administration, faculty.","","This essay appeared in Wheaton's \"New Faculty Handbook.\" The Handbook was edited by Alan Jacobs, who was serving at the time as coordinator of the faith and learning program. Most of the essay content draws on what Hamilton had published earlier in the 90s, including his Notre Dame dissertation\n\nThe essay details Wheaton's move out of the anti-modernist, fundamentalist camp into \"the promised land of interdenominational evangelicalism\" in the 1950s. Hamilton then charts the ways in which the college sought to \"maintain its dual citizenship in the evangelical world and the world of [secular] higher education.\" It did so by means of what he calls the \"four models,\" one of which is \"the integration of faith and learning\" model. \n\nLaying aside his historian's cap, Hamilton concludes with his personal opinion that Wheaton has missed numerous opportunities to be a leader in the area of faith-learning integration because of fear-based decision making:  \"Fear [among others] that academic excellence will lead to apostasy. And feeding all these, the supreme fear that I\u2019ve not yet named\u2014that deviation from the constituency\u2019s beliefs and values will threaten the survival of the college.\"","This book features nine essays exploring shifting relations between Christianity and secular rationality. Introduced by editor Bloechl (Boston College), the essays are written by prominent American philosophers and theologians working in the Catholic tradition. Their orientation is primarily Continental rather than Anglo-American. The book began as a set of seminar papers, and the finished essays have the feel of a sustained conversation, even though the contributors do not explicitly engage each other. The discussion focuses on ways that changing religious and secular conceptions of reason and faith challenge, complement, threaten, and depend on one another. Some of the essays are more thematic than historical. However, their arc is broadly historical--from foundations in 12th- and 13th-century thinkers through modern development of robust and confident secular reason (especially in the figure of Kant) to postmodern (and postsecular) themes and figures such as John Milbank, Jean-Luc Marion, and Jurgen Habermas and his engagement with Pope Benedict XVI. The essays are deeply conversant with a broad range of scholarly literature and will be of interest to serious students and scholars. (From the Introduction)","","","","Theological education has always been vital to the Church\u2019s life and mission; yet today it is in crisis, lacking focus, direction, but also resources and even students. In the early Church, there is no doubt that to lead worship one had to be able to read and interpret the Bible. In order to lead, it was necessary to know at least something about the history of Israel and the work of God in the Gospels, and interpret that history, making it relevant to daily living. Quickly the Church developed schools for its teachers, whether lay or clergy. A catechetical system was organized through which candidates prepared for baptism were given a basic form of theological education. Hence to be a Christian meant persons knew what and why they believed. But over the years, theological education has come to mean education for clergy and church professionals. It has drifted, seeking new moorings.","This book details major developments in the history of Christian education. It offers a context for understanding present-day educational efforts among Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Orthodox Christians. The history presents the major thinkers and practitioners who have influenced how Christians transmit their faith to both children and adults. It also shows how major historical events and intellectual movements have impacted the shape and content of Christian education.","","What does it mean to be a human being made in the image of God? In this book Nonna Verna Harrison, a respected specialist in early Eastern Christianity, offers a fresh approach to theological anthropology by revealing the thought of leading early church theologians concerning what it means to be human. Throughout the ages Christians have believed that the image of God in which we are created is at the core of who we are as humans. Theologians and spiritual writers have found the divine image in many different aspects of human identity. Drawing on the wisdom of the desert mothers and fathers and the heritage of Eastern Christianity, Harrison makes the case that the divine image can be seen in not just one or two aspects of human identity but in all of them. Each chapter explores a different facet of the divine image and likeness and maps out a path that can lead toward wholeness and holiness. Harrison challenges the popularized negative view of human nature as inherently bad by proposing an alternative grounded in early Greek Christian sources. God's Many-Splendored Image brings Greek patristic theology to students in a readable fashion and will work well in theology, patristics, ministry, missions, and anthropology courses.

Doesn\u2019t the traditional goal of theological study, which is to attain knowledge of the divine, fundamentally conflict with the main goal of secular academic study, which is to attain knowledge about ourselves and the world in which we live?? So why should theology be admitted, or even care about being admitted, into secular academic life? And even if theology were admitted, what contribution to secular academic life could it make?  Working from a Christian philosophical and theological perspective but also engaging a wide range of theologians, philosophers, and religious studies scholars, Christian Theology and the Secular University takes on these questions, arguing that Christian theology does belong in the secular university because it provides distinct resources that the secular university needs if it is going to fulfill what should be its main epistemic and educative ends.? This book offers a fresh and unique perspective to scholars working in the disciplines of theology, philosophy, and religious studies, and to those in other academic disciplines who are interested in thinking critically and creatively about the place and nature of theological study within the secular university.","Over the last two decades, the American academy has engaged in a wide-ranging discourse on faith and learning, religion and higher education, and Christianity and the academy. Eastern Orthodox Christians, however, have rarely participated in these conversations. The contributors to this volume aim to reverse this trend by offering original insights from Orthodox Christian perspectives into the ongoing discussion about religion, higher education, and faith and learning in the United States. The book is divided into two parts. Essays in the first part explore the historical experiences and theological traditions that inform (and sometimes explain) Orthodox approaches to the topic of religion and higher education\u2014in ways that often set them apart from their Protestant and Roman Catholic counterparts. Those in the second part problematize and reflect on Orthodox thought and practice from diverse disciplinary contexts in contemporary higher education. The contributors to this volume offer provocative insights into philosophical questions about the relevance and application of Orthodox ideas in the religious and secular academy, as well as cross-disciplinary treatments of Orthodoxy as an identity marker, pedagogical framework, and teaching and research subject. \"Seldom have so many scholars representing such a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities (even the hard sciences) been brought together to address the important issue of faith and learning through the prism of various aspects of the Eastern Orthodox tradition. The fact that all but one of these contributors are themselves Orthodox Christian scholars provides ample proof that most likely representatives of Orthodox Christianity will be active participants in the ongoing debate addressing the crucial question of faith and the academy, or Athens and Jerusalem, to borrow Tertullian's much abused epigrammatic description of the phenomenon. Eastern Orthodox Christianity and American Higher Education will be useful to the growing number of classes on Eastern Orthodox history and culture taught in American colleges and universities.\" \u2014Theofanis G. Stavrou, University of Minnesota","","In the modern university, religion is often taken to school--primarily in the sense of being critiqued, disciplined, and domesticated. In this provocative book, Stephen Webb steps into the middle of current controversies about the place of religion in secular high schools and colleges. Speaking explicitly as a Christian theologian, but also as one who accepts the reality of religious pluralism, Webb argues that the teaching of religion is itself a religious activity, that teachers of religion should not disguise their own faiths in the classroom, and that high schools and universities should allow more--not less--space for religious voices.","","","The scholastic debate about use and interpretation of the phrase \u201cfaith-learning integration\u201d has spanned over fifty years. Glanzer (2008) proposed that this phrase be discarded and that scholars adopt the terminology of \"creation and redemption of scholarship.\u201d This concept is not new to Christian dialogue: it can be found in the writings of St. Augustine. However, there needs to be further clarification of Glanzer\u2019s language in order to make it accessible to people of all faiths, backgrounds, and education levels. This paper will attempt to support both Glanzer\u2019s proposal and a new direction for the discussion and encourage educators to adopt this new language as faith-based scholars.\n[Author-supplied abstract]","Calvin professor and philosopher, James Smith, in the book Desiring the Kingdom, offers his critique of modern day evangelical Christian higher education. Part of the problem lies in its prevailing anthropology, which remains bound by an overly rationalistic view of human nature, and reflects the continued influence of Enlightenment thinkers such as Descarte and Kant. The reality is, Smith argues, we live and move and have our being according to not what we think or believe, but what we desire, and especially the desires rooted in our vision of the good life, and of human flourishing.","\"This book explores the role that reflective Christian faith can play in unifying the intellectual life of the university,\" and specifically the church-related universities and colleges.

John Behr (St. Vladimir Seminary) St. Gregory Nazianzen's oration, On St. Basil the Great, Bishop of Caesarea, contains the most powerful apolegetic in early Christianity for the value and utility of learning for the Christian. Specifically, Gregory argues that from the study of secular literature we have received \u201cthe principles of inquiry and contemplation,\u201d theoria, that deeper level of understanding that comes after we understand the words on the page, grammar, which helps to see why grammar, rhetoric and logic formed the foundation - trivuum - of a \u201cclassical education.\u201d","Physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) is considered by many to have been as important\nto physics as Newton and Einstein, especially for his work on electricity and magnetism\nand for being the first director of the Cavendish Laboratory.

This work explores his writings and discusses some of his various\nexperiences, such as his broad education at the University of Edinburgh and participation\nin elite intellectual discussion societies, which developed and demonstrated his ability to\nthink broadly. In some instances, he shared about his faith in God and how it informed his\nperspectives.

According to one reviewer,  Ellspermann's basic thesis--that the attitude of the Fathers toward pagan learning, generally, was negative  at first but becomes increasingly sympathetic--had already been established by other scholars, and thus represented \"a safe conclusion.\" That said, it remains a helpful introduction to the topic in spite of it not being particularly well written. The author includes summaries of each chapter, which annoys the specialists apparently, but is helpful for the rest of us. In once such summary the author states that, by the time the Latin apologists, Minucius Felix and Tertullian, come on the scene (early 3rd century), the Greek fathers had largely worked out the issue of accommodation as it relates to pagan learning. And by the mid-3rd century most Christian writers embraced the usefulness of pagan literature and learning for Christians, though with a few exceptions such as Tertullian and Aristides the Athenian. Speaking of Tertullian, one so often \"maligned in that which has to do with issues of faith and reason,\" check out Justo Gonzalez's article <a href=\"http:\/\/ezproxy.wheaton.edu\/login?url=http:\/\/search.ebscohost.com\/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rfh&AN=ATLA0000739460&site=ehost-live\">Athens and Jerusalem Revisited: Reason and Authority in Tertullian<\/a>.","This is a collection of Breen's writings.

Churches in Origen's time often took the form of a philosophical school as was the case with him, and an extent letter from one of his disciples gives us a good sense of how these schools operated, and just how secular learning served to prepare one for theological studies.

Such lengthy conversations are complicated by variations in nomenclature, attitudes, and theological assumptions. This paper attempts to clarify portions of this historical discussions by focusing on how a given thinker weighs and balances four interrelated doctrinal issues: the unity of truth, the two sources of knowledge, the noetic effects of sin, and goodness of creation. It is suggested that thinkers commonly adopt one of five \"integrative\" postures: butcher, baker, candlestick maker, philosopher, or prophet. Lessons are drawn from this history and applied to some of the issues that face the academy today.","","This article argues that a coherent and inspired general education program, infused with a deliberate vision of the liberal arts, is crucial to the flourishing of Christian higher education. This article begins by describing the context and status of general education, emphasizing how this element of the educational program falls short in embodying a distinctive mission of Christian higher education. This article then contends that a vibrant vision of general education will be grounded in particular aspects of a liberal arts education that fulfill crucial outcomes of the Christian university, specifically cultivating the formal virtues and fostering meaning and purpose. The article concludes with recommendations for advancing the aims of general education within Christian higher education, highlighting the benefits of a common curriculum and intentional faculty development.","This article does not attempt to address the many and varied changes currently facing Christian higher education, but seeks to provide a framework for thinking about the future that is grounded in the church's heritage and tradition. Believing that the secular culture is indifferent to the Christian faith and that the Christ world tends to be confused about its heritage and beliefs, the article proposes that the Christian tradition, informed by the Nicene Creed, offers a hopeful way forward. At the heart of Christian higher education is a calling to prepare a new generation of Christians to think Christianly, to engage the culture and the academy, to serve society, and to renew connections with the church and its mission. Contending that limiting Christ-centeredness to the sphere of personal piety or activism is minimalistic and inadequate, the article also suggests that any attempt to envision a faithful Christian higher education for the future that is not tightly tethered to the great Christian tradition will likely result in an education model that lacks a compass. The uniting of the Christian tradition with learning is proposed as the pathway forward for understanding the essence of Christian higher education. In doing so, this article offers a pathway that focuses on the central and foundational commitments needed to sustain a faithful future for Christian higher education.","This article presents a discussion of the gender imbalance in senior-level leadership roles within the U.S. member institutions of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU), highlighting data across the last two decades. The underrepresentation of women in this sector is placed within a theological context and is compared with other sectors of U.S. higher education. Insights from the secular literature provide an introductory context for the article's presentation of the data. Although the CCCU member institutions collectively serve a student body that is 60% female, a 2015 analysis of individuals holding \u201cvice president\u201d or higher titles (e.g., senior vice president, executive vice president) revealed that women held fewer than 30% of those employed in any particular leadership role (e.g., chief academic officer) and only slightly over 20% of all senior leadership roles. Notably, when a national study compared the leadership composition of 1,481 evangelical non-profit organizations with their secular counterparts, the representation of women on boards and senior leadership teams was found to be about half of that found in the secular nonprofits (Reynolds, 2014). Although Christian colleges and universities have an opportunity to set the standard within higher education for identifying, encouraging, and deploying the gifts of individuals across racial and gender lines, a variety of environmental and internalized barriers hinder the affirmation and development of women's leadership identity and advancement. Five recommended action steps conclude the article, with a call to reimagine Christian higher education as being places of learning characterized by fully affirming and developing the potential of all within their span of care.","Leaders of evangelical Christian colleges must navigate a challenging environment shaped by public concern about college costs and educational quality, federal inclinations toward increased regulation, and lingering fallout from the Great Recession. Proceeding from the premise that empirical analysis empowers institutional actors to lead well in uncertain times, this article examines four key areas\u2014access, affordability, student outcomes, and financial sustainability\u2014using publicly available data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). Results for the evangelical segment and the wider private nondoctoral sector of American higher education are compared, and areas of relative strength and weakness are considered. To facilitate benchmarking by institutional research professionals, the article's appendix presents national longitudinal norms for both the evangelical segment and the private nondoctoral sector.","An introduction to the journal is presented which discusses articles on topics including the underrepresentation of women in positional leadership, the campus spiritual climate for LGBTQ students enrolled in Christian colleges, and the future of Christian higher education.","The focus of this article centers on three specific themes of disruption that are likely to affect the future of Christian higher education. The first theme examines the juxtaposition of faith-based institutional identity and its influence on a post-modern society. The second theme explores the disaggregation of traditional faculty functions and the impact on student learning and institutional effectiveness. The last theme addresses changing student demographics and the associated expectations of this post-traditional population. The magnitude and complexity of these themes requires dynamic and flexible leadership at the board, administrative, and faculty levels. This article distinguishes between disruptive and technical change, and identifies how each approach impacts the unique social concerns facing faith-based institutions today. The article concludes by proposing new models of institutional collaboration and innovative cultures of learning that will meet the pragmatic need for institutional efficiency and effectiveness.","The challenges facing higher education continue to mount. The shifting of the U.S. ethnic and racial demographics, the proliferation of advanced digital technologies and data, and the move from traditional degrees to continuous learning platforms have created an unstable environment to which Christian higher education must adapt in order to remain viable and ultimately to thrive. Courageous leadership is needed to confront a mindset of scarcity and address the resistance created by a tendency to protect the status quo. By challenging existing assumptions and searching for deep, adaptive solutions, Christian colleges and universities can maintain their unique distinctive as they reimagine their approach to education. This article ends with an imaginative look at the future of faith-based higher education.","","","","","","","","","In an era of rapid societal change, institutions of higher education are grappling with how to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals are safe and supported on campus. Many challenges remain as LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff are subject to continued acts of discrimination and subtle microaggressions on a regular basis, according to national assessments of campus climate. When religion and spirituality are salient on campus or in the lived experiences of LGBTQ people, the complexities of faith as it intersects with sexuality and gender identity become increasingly apparent. In this essay, we portray current issues concerning the campus climate in an effort to imagine how Christian higher education leaders might respond in light of institutional aims to promote the spiritual growth of all members of their campus communities.","This study explored the predictors of success among 1,536 students of color from 12 Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU) member institutions. Student success was measured by examining students' intent to graduate along with the degree to which they were thriving intellectually, socially, and psychologically. The study utilized an instrument that included the Thriving Quotient (Schreiner, 2012), which measures students' psychosocial well-being, along with scales that assessed students' psychological sense of community, perceptions of institutional integrity and commitment to student welfare, spirituality, and satisfaction with student\u2013faculty interaction. The path model explained 35% of the variation in intent to graduate from their chosen CCCU institution among this sample of students of color. In addition to three factors that directly contributed to students' intent to graduate from their institutions\u2014institutional fit, thriving in their role as students, and students' perceptions of the institutions' commitment to their welfare\u2014the model revealed significant indirect contributors to the success of students of color. Recommendations based on these findings include creating campus environments, policies, and practices that consider the unique needs of all students, equipping faculty for inclusive pedagogy, and delivering on the implicit institutional promises made to students of color during the admissions process.","The future of Christian higher education is not certain, and faith-based institutions will need to continue to convince prospective students that the experiences they offer are worth the investment. What is missing in the discussion of what makes Christian higher education special is the transformational experience provided outside of the classroom. To this end, residential life and student affairs in Christian higher education is an area of untapped potential critical to the future of these campuses. When taking into account the lost role of service in the professoriate, the research on the impact of living on campus on student success, and the research on the importance of student-faculty interaction, it becomes evident that residential communities can be transformed into environments that offer an integrated, holistic education that is vital to the mission of Christian institutions.","","","","","","","","What is Christian wisdom for living in the twenty-first century? Where is it to be found? How can it be learnt? In the midst of diverse religions and worldviews and the demands and complexities of our world, David Ford explores a Christian way of uniting love of wisdom with wisdom in love. Core elements are the 'discernment of cries', the love of God for God's sake, interpretation of scripture, and the shaping of desire in faith. Case studies deal with inter-faith wisdom among Jews, Christians and Muslims, universities as centres of wisdom as well as knowledge and know-how and the challenge of learning disabilities. Throughout, there is an attempt to do justice to the premodern, modern and postmodern while grappling with scripture, tradition and the cries of the world today. Ford opens up the rich resources of Christianity in engaging with the issues and urgencies of contemporary life.","","See chapter entitled \"Theological education in the Christian East, 1st to 6th centuries.\"","","Although significant strides have been made in developing graduate training programs in psychology with a distinctively Christian perspective, much remains to be done.

Scholars, university administrators, and even the Vatican have staked out positions debating Shaw's observation. In this refreshing book, George Dennis O'Brien argues that contradiction arises both from the secular university's limited concept of academic freedom and the church's defective notion of dogma.Truth is a central concept for both university and church, and O'Brien's book is built on the idea that there are different areas of truth\u2014scientific, artistic, and religious\u2014each with its own proper warrant and \"method.\" In this light, he argues that one can reverse Shaw's comparison and uncover academic dogma and Christian freedom, university \"infallibility\" and dogmatic \"fallibility.\"Drawing on theology and the history of philosophy, O'Brien shows how religious truth relates to the work of a Catholic university. He then turns to the current controversies over Pope John Paul II's recent statement, Ex Corde Ecclesiae, which seeks to make Catholic universities conform to the church's official teaching office. O'Brien rejects the conventional \"institutional-juridical\" model used by the Vatican as improper both to faith and academic freedom. He argues for a \"sacramental\" model, one that respects the different kinds of \"truth\"\u2014thus preserving the integrity of both church and university while making their combination in a Catholic university not only possible but desirable. O'Brien concludes with a practical consideration of how the ideal Catholic university might be expressed in the actual life of the contemporary curriculum and extracurriculum.For anyone concerned about the place of religion in higher education, The Idea of a Catholic University will be essential reading.

While various models of integration have been developed, the question remains, \"Are these schools practicing Christian education through faith-learning integration?\"\nChapter 2 suggested through the precedent literature review that Christian education has been a vital part of learning throughout history. The development of educational legislation and compartmentalized framework for living prompted the conception of faith-learning integration.\nChapter 3 examined the methodology for this research which included a sequential mixed method study and statistical comparison of the learning factors within evangelical secondary schools. The qualitative method included 15 interviews with evangelical secondary administrators to identify learning factors necessary within secondary education. The quantitative method utilized a Likert-style survey that measured the perceptions of the various learning factors related to the integration process. This survey was administered to a sample of administrators associated with the Association of Christian Schools International.\nChapter 4 and Chapter 5 present the compilation of data and statistical analysis. This research examined the relationship between the perceived level of importance and the participation level of the learning factors by the institution. Each of the thirteen factors had a positive relationship between the level of importance and the degree of participation. The research examined the relationship between the student learning factors and the institutional learning factors in the faith-learning integration process. Hiring Christian faculty was identified as the most essential element of integration and perceived as practiced. Of the 30 essential elements queried, the survey resulted in 7 of the top 10 essential elements being student learning factors. The most important institutional learning factor found was providing a holistic approach to education. An environment that supports Christian values was identified as the most important student learning factor. The development of a Christian worldview through a bibliocentric philosophy was also found fundamental in the integration process.","Introduction. The history of American Christian higher education reveals a trend where many institutions founded on Christian principles have been gradually transformed by secular ideas that have embedded themselves into their organizational cultures. However, this historical trend did not go unchecked, as a cadre of institution leaders has in recent decades endeavored to reverse the influences of secularization by renewing the Christian perspective through the integration of faith and learning.\n\nPurpose and method of study. With little known about the effectiveness of the efforts by such leaders to establish the integration of faith and learning as the organizational culture's norm, the study investigated this by utilizing a survey instrument that sought alumni's perceptions of whether the integration of faith and learning occurred during their educational experience. 627 Missouri Baptist University alumni were surveyed from four sampling points, per alumni's graduation year: 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. Two levels of data were generated, descriptive and statistical. The research hypothesis had anticipated differences in the means of the four groups and that the means would increase as an indication of the extent to which the integration of faith and learning had pervaded the institution's organizational culture, thus the effectiveness of the leadership's efforts.\n\nResults and conclusions. The findings confirmed the research hypothesis. A cross-sectional consensus emerged that the integration of faith and learning had occurred. The findings implied that Christian higher education leaders who explicitly seek to renew the Christian perspective and to reverse the effects of secularization through the integration of faith and learning, will meet with measurable success.","Badley has written extensively on FLI since the 90s.

Henry, beginning with Remaking the Modern Mind (1946)...If I am correct that the new book provides a fresh idea or two, it does so with the deepest indebtedness \u2014 to the earlier trail-blazing of Carl Henry and other \u201cneo-evangelical\u201d stalwarts...\"","","Although the integration of faith and learning presupposes a learner, little theoretical work has addressed the role of students in faith-learning integration. Moreover, many students perceive faith-learning integration to be the work of teachers and institutions, suggesting that for learners, integration is a passive experience. This theoretical paper proposes an active, critical-thinking skills model for the conduct of faith-learning integration that may guide teachers in developing courses that support students in developing the skills needed for independent faith-learning integration.","In 1971 ten Christian colleges resisted the ongoing trend of secularization within American higher education through the formation of a Consortium designed promote collaboration among Christian institutions. Since then, the Consortium has transformed into the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU), with 116 member institutions dedicated to the advancement of Christ-centered higher education. One of the primary distinctives of the CCCU has been to promote the \"integration of faith and learning.\"\nGiven that membership in the CCCU requires faculty to integrate their faith into the classroom, the purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions of faculty members at seven CCCU member institutions about their preference of different faith-learning integration approaches and their level of involvement in the integration process. Related research questions sought to identify the presence and size of any significant relationships, differences, and associations between\/among the perceptions of different faculty groups.\nThe researcher used descriptive research methodology and a survey to collect the data. Seven institutions were randomly selected through a stratified random sample, with faith tradition serving as the stratum. A survey measuring faculty perceptions, with confirmed validity and internal reliability, was developed, piloted, and completed by 305 faculty. Perceptions of integration approaches were measured against seven different integration models created by the researcher through a meta-synthesis of the literature. Perceptions of integration involvement were measured against an adaptation Korniejczuk and Kijai's (1994) scale of integration implementation.\nThe study found that six faculty characteristics had a significant affect on perceptions of different integration approaches, and 19 faculty characteristics had a significant affect on perceptions of involvement. Overall, the greatest influences were institution of employment, academic discipline, age, years employed, personal religious orientation, and participation in professional development. These findings suggest that leaders of CCCU member institutions are able to identify which types of faculty would agree with certain models of integration, and how involved they would likely be in a newly created, four-stage integration involvement process. The study also confirms the importance of professional development for institutional leaders who want to improve their faculty's understanding and involvement in the integration of faith and learning.","The purpose of this volume is to offer an authoritative overview of the positive relationship between faith and reason, the latter understood as a different mode of philosophy.

Data included participants' perceptions about what evidence there is that faith is integrated with learning at their school. Participants were asked to report evidence of faith being integral in the life of the school in general, in school and curricular documents, in the classroom environment, and in instruction. In addition, participants were asked about religious neutrality, the idea of the sacred and secular in the curriculum, and whether faith is explicitly or implicit integrated in the curriculum. Theoretical constructs based on the philosophies of 19 th century Dutch neocalvinism and 20th century reformed epistemology informed the study, and a framework of curricular integration adapted from recent work in multicultural education served to structure the analysis and discussion.\nKeywords: integration of faith and learning (IFL), Christian school, Reformed epistemology, Banks, Bavinck, Kuyper, Polanyi, Van Til","In the current atmosphere of expanding school choice, evangelical Christian schools provide a distinctive alternative consistent with deeply held beliefs of what is required for human flourishing, and represent a significant resource for parents seeking education based on a perspective diverging from those promoted by popular culture and public schools. However, current research reveals a pervasive gap between the ideal of a school integrating Christian faith with academic instruction and the actual practice found in most evangelical Christian schools. One key to closing the gap is specialized teacher preparation. Using a conceptual model of the characteristics of distinctive schools, this research identifies beliefs, knowledge, skills and characteristics that teachers should possess in order to promote distinctive evangelical schools.\nThe dissertation reviews literature on the philosophy of evangelical Christian schooling and conceptual models for the integration of faith in learning, and contrasts the teacher-training model for evangelical schools with that for Montessori and Waldorf schools. Surveys of education professors at evangelical Christian colleges, administrators of Christian schools, and teachers currently working in Christian schools provide extensive evidence on prevailing beliefs about the characteristics of successful teachers for such schools. Interviews with faculty of colleges in different evangelical traditions document how they provide pre-service teachers with specialized training to work in Christian schools.\nThe research found a striking lack of alignment between the major stakeholder groups with regard to teacher preparation for evangelical schooling and a series of bad ideas and practices that further undermine evangelical schooling, including a tendency to neglect the study of the truth of general revelation and a distorted hermeneutic that views the Bible as a textbook for the academic disciplines. These factors contribute to widespread confusion concerning the academic mission of evangelical Christian schooling and limit the ability of Christian-school students to engage the culture in the various academic disciplines with a cohesive and defensible faith.\nThe conclusions include specific recommendations for the professional associations, education professors, administrators, and teachers to promote teacher preparation for distinctive evangelical schools.","The intersection of faith and learning within Christian colleges and universities is critical to the overall mission and ethos of these higher education institutions, as these concepts form their foundation. This study examines student perceptions of faith integration in online classrooms verses onsite classrooms. The students' experiences were evaluated through a survey instrument focused on faith integration within the context of the curriculum and faith integration within the context of faculty as spiritual mentors. As the proliferation of Christian higher education with regards to the adult education demographic continues to grow, the leaders of such organizations can benefit from pertinent data. The results of this study provide a guiding tool to ensure faith integration is transpiring, no matter the modality of learning.","","Moroney (Malone Univ., OH) attempts to \"re-map the current state of how Christian scholars approach the intersection of faith and learning.\" This article updates Hasker's FLI survey work from 1992, \"Faith-learning integration: an overview.\"\n\n\"The project of faith-learning integration is an effort to 'reintegrate' spheres of truth that have been artifically [disintegrated] in academic circles since the Enlightenment.\" 141","The integration of faith and learning is regarded to be a primary distinctive of Christian higher education, yet this terminology conveys a false dichotomy. The frequent call for integration suggests that the Christian faith and learning belong to different areas of knowledge and practice; consequently, there is a need for bringing the two realms together. In this article, a biblical worldview is presented as the unifying factor for the fusion of faith and learning. The biblical narrative provides a solid foundation for a comprehensive worldview, offering implications for the Christian faith and Christian higher education.","Publisher's summary: Evangelical Christianity is a paradox. Evangelicals are radically individualist, but devoted to community and family. They believe in the transformative power of a personal relationship with God, but are wary of religious enthusiasm. They are deeply skeptical of secular reason, but eager to find scientific proof that the Bible is true. \n\nIn this groundbreaking history of modern American evangelicalism, Molly Worthen argues that these contradictions are the products of a crisis of authority that lies at the heart of the faith. Evangelicals have never had a single authority to guide them through these dilemmas or settle the troublesome question of what the Bible actually means. Worthen chronicles the ideological warfare, institutional conflict, and clashes between modern gurus and maverick disciples that lurk behind the more familiar narrative of the rise of the Christian Right. The result is an ambitious intellectual history that weaves together stories from all corners of the evangelical world to explain the ideas and personalities-the scholarly ambitions and anti-intellectual impulses-that have made evangelicalism a cultural and political force.\n\nIn Apostles of Reason, Worthen recasts American evangelicalism as a movement defined not by shared doctrines or politics, but by the problem of reconciling head knowledge and heart religion in an increasingly secular America. She shows that understanding the rise of the Christian Right in purely political terms, as most scholars have done, misses the heart of the story. The culture wars of the late twentieth century emerged not only from the struggle between religious conservatives and secular liberals, but also from the civil war within evangelicalism itself-a battle over how to uphold the commands of both faith and reason, and how ultimately to lead the nation back onto the path of righteousness.","","","Books and Culture editor John Wilson inteviews Todd Ream and Perry Glanzer about their book, The Idea of a Christian College: a Reexamination, which is a sort of festscrift in honor of Arthur Holmes.","","\"This then was the educational ideal of Reformation Protestantism: a comprehensive study of human knowledge in all branches within a context of biblical revelation. The seven liberal arts we 'a circle of seven sections of which the center is God.' The result was what today we would call Christian liberal education--the pursuit of the integration of all human knowledge within the Christian faith, and the formation of people qualified to function competently in all areas of life.\" (48)","","","The question of the separation of church and state has had a powerful secularizing influence on higher education religious schools, which have become increasingly dependent on federal funding. Since the 1970's, many religious schools have moved from a \"two-sphere\" philosophy, in which secular and religious topics are approached separately, to an integrationist philosophy in which all learning is united under a spiritual worldview. At the same time, the Supreme Court has moved away from the \"pervasively sectarian\" test for allowing public funding of religious colleges. A school with an integrationist approach would have more trouble defending itself against accusations of being pervasively sectarian than one with a two-sphere approach, but the Supreme Court's shift to a neutrality test, allowing religious groups to receive support on the same basis as secular groups, offers more hope for integrationist schools. Still, state restrictions, the advance of secularization, and threats of further lawsuits could discourage church-related schools from expressing their faith more openly than they have been.","","","A collection of 18 essays that aim to articulate the history and mission of evangelical higher education.

Lonergan attempts to work out, in the context of the human good and the 'new learning,' the rudiments of a philosophy of education based on his well-known discovery of norms in the unfolding of intelligent, reasonable, and responsible consciousness. He explores how the scientific revolution has changed ways of understanding reality, and examines the implications of this revolution for education.\n\nTopics in Education, the first publication of his 1959 lectures, follows Lonergan on his early explorations of human development, studies the theories ofJean Piaget and others, and concludes with his own original ideas in the realms of ethics, art, and history.\n\nBernard Lonergan (1904-1984), a professor of theology, taught at Regis College, Harvard University, and Boston College.

He was a consummate classicist, and also wrote extensively on the life and thought of Gregory of Nyssa. \n\nThis short work of 154 pages chronicles the encounter of Greek thought and early Christianity in the figures of Clement of Alexandria and Origen that would prepare the path for great synthesis of Greek culture and the Christian religion as embodied in the lives and works of the Cappodocian Fathers and Macrina, sister to Gregory of Nyssa and Basil the Great.\n\nNoteworthy as it relates to integration is Jaeger's discussion of Gregory of Nyssa later in the book, and specifically the way Gregory develops a Christian counterpart of the classical Greek concept of paideia. At the core of Gregory's Christian paideia is the Bible, which replaces the corpus of Greek literature as the object of learning, the form that molds a person. \"Christ is the form,\" Jaeger writes, and he must take shape\" in us. To the extent that we have been molded by the Bible, by Christ, we are prepared for the successful integration of faith and learning.","","Wolterstorff considers the age-old question most famously penned by Tertullian in the 3rd century, \"What has Athens to do with Jerusalem,\" and more specifically, \"how should Christians interpret pagan literature and philosophy?\"\n\nPertinent to faith and learning and the two realms of knowledge, religious and secular, he writes: \"Our savior did not teach us the whole truth; he did teach us nothing but truth; there was no falsehood mingled in.

Organ defines  integration (theoretical and practical together) as \"the process of discovery or creation by which seemingly divergent elements become parts of a whole.\" (182)\n\nLike many others, then and now, Organ identifies the principal obstacle of theoretical integration (dialectic) to be \"the tragic inability of scholars to communicate with one another...\"(182)\n\nHis construct of theoretical and practical integration might be of use in the Christian discussion of faith-learning integration.

Today the academy is in a state of turmoil, torn apart by market-driven pressures, systematic underfunding by central government, overworked and highly stressed staff, increased student numbers and an ever widening division between research-led and teaching-led institutions.

K., Europe, North America, and Australasia. In this timely and provocative collection of essays, scholars from across the world re-examine the idea of a Christian university and offer a radical alternative vision for the future of the academy.

Thirty-one students were asked by the professor to complete an open-ended questionnaire at the end of their course experience. Results indicated that students in this study described or defined the integration of faith and learning in ways reflective of the content of the courses, which was teaching methods. While not all students said integration of faith and learning occurred in the classes, all students did provide examples of integrative moments. Most students described faith-learning integration in terms of teacher actions rather than student actions. Thus, it appears that these students were describing integration of faith and teaching more so than integration of faith and learning.

Building on competent historical and analytical studies of the past decade, the contributors consider the nature of religious education generally, explore the relationship between religious colleges and their sponsoring churches, probe a number of successful educational models, and examine the influence of public policy on religious colleges. Taken together, these constructive essays demonstrate that religious colleges still have the potential to serve well the missions of their churches and to provide a creative leaven for the advancement of academics in America.","","Although a significant literature now exists on the integration of Christian faith with learning and other academic pursuits, much of that discussion has centered on establishing boundaries and constructing models of what composes satisfactory integration. One issue still missing from the discussion is the various roles played by Christians in the academy as they pursue integrative activity. After a brief review of the existing emphases on integration, this essay proposes a 2 x 2 matrix consisting of two variables, alternative world views and social roles, that depict Christians' integrative efforts. It describes in detail two of the resulting role identities, prophet and debunker, with several suggestions of practical implications that result, as Christian academics fulfill these two primary roles in their integrative work at Christian institutions.","","","Hughes is Pepperdine (Church of Christ) Distinguished Professor Emeritus and directed the Pepperdine Center for Faith and Learning from 1999-2005.

Yet many have felt compelled to check their faith at the doors of our educational institutions. Intimidated by a daunting amalgam of naturalism and postmodernism, they have been silenced by secularists' insistence that faith has no place in the quest for knowledge. In Faith and Learning on the Edge, David Claerbaut refutes this fallacy. He shows how those who espouse a values-neutral approach to knowledge and research fail to live up to their own standard. In capitulating to them by separating faith from learning, Christians abdicate their responsibility toward both higher education and the culture at large. Believers must reintegrate their faith as a crucial component of learning, insists the author, and he explores ways in which this can be accomplished....And he considers how to apply a faith-and-learning approach across a broad spectrum of disciplines in the physical sciences, the arts and humanities, and the behavioral sciences.","","","","","","This study examines the impact that mentoring relationships have on the socialization experience of new and first-time faculty at campuses within the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities (CCCU). The study sought to compare and contrast formal and informal mentoring in the assimilation process. Additionally, the project explored the role that mentors play in helping new faculty understand and embrace the campus expectation that they will impact the intellectual and spiritual development of their students. The research structure was qualitative and employed phenomenological analysis methodologies. Eight different faculty were interviewed on eight distinct Midwestern CCCU campuses. Five participants were male with one being black, and three participants were female.\nThe study first saw that these mentoring relationships proved to be a formal\/informal hybrid model. Neither fully formal nor informal, mentoring efforts were value added components of systematic institutional orientation programming which was the central vehicle for successful assimilation of new faculty. Second, new faculty needed to understand and implement the implicit expectation to integrate personal Christian faith with student learning. The ability to implement \"faith integration\" was a critical entry experience. Third, new CCCU faculty believed they were \"called\" by God to their school and this belief impacted their sense of belonging and was seen as a pre-disposition to assimilation. Finally, proactive engagement by new faculty and successful campus relationships improved their sense of belonging. New faculty played a supporting role in their own assimilation.\nThis study informs CCCU campuses that sustained orientation programming for new faculty is critical. Mentoring is a valuable and needed assistant, but orientation that includes equipping faculty to understand and implement \"faith integration\" is vital. The intersection of personal spiritual commitment with the role of instructor deserves additional attention. How should CCCU campuses best prepare their new faculty to succeed and realize this campus expectation?","Recently, enrollment in adult education\/graduate programs at GFU has eclipsed undergraduate enrollment. Absent are adult\/graduate student requirements that help maintain an environment that embraces the University's mission and commitment to faith and learning integration (FLI). The question arises as to how that commitment to FLI is being fulfilled in graduate programs. This research sought to explore graduate faculty's perceptions and practices of FLI, as well as student perceptions of faith and learning, in an effort to see how the mission statement's commitment to FLI was being fulfilled. A case study research design was employed whereby data was collected through open-ended interviews of 40 faculty and 60 student in 4 graduate programs at George Fox University. Responses were coded to discover major themes. Results indicated there is no unified perception of the meaning and purpose of FLI, and no consistency of practice across all programs. Individual programs did contain some consistent perceptions and practices. Student responses indicated that overall, FLI was not observed by students as intentional, systematic, or a highly prioritized occurrence within their programs, excepting the PSYD. Results indicate that the University's commitment to FLI lacks a consistency or uniformity in practice, as well as lacking a unifying philosophy as to meaning and purpose. To continue to fulfill its mission at the graduate level, GFU needs to renew its commitment to FLI by equipping all faculty with the knowledge, skills, and motivation to successfully integrate faith and learning.","Many Christian colleges agree that the integration of faith and learning is an important distinction. This project assisted faculty members at Emmanuel College in Franklin Springs, Georgia to move integration beyond mere words into practical action that would affect student learning.\nI conducted a general seminar to give information, create a baseline of knowledge, and begin a campus-wide discussion on the implementation of faith and learning integration. Through research of current literature on the subject and perspectives on the theological implications, I formulated the seminar. In addition, throughout the seminar, I cited multiple resources, and participants were given access to helpful and informative information about integration in general and integration application within given academic disciplines.\nFollowing the seminar, I held an idea session to further encourage brainstorming and networking of practical ways to bring the concepts we had covered regarding faith and learning into the classroom. The broad-based participation both in the seminar and the idea session spoke to the perceived need and interest of the faculty in the subject matter. The idea session provided additional resources and sparked in-depth discussions.\nThis project resulted in both qualitative and quantitative improvements in knowledge, understanding, and confidence in the faculty to integrate faith and learning. The project design, along with the faculty participation, allowed a measurable beginning to occur on the campus of Emmanuel College that will have lasting results.","This study identified tenure policies and practices among Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU) member schools. A survey of CCCU member schools was conducted; 65 usable questionnaires were received. A response rate of 69% was achieved. Schools also provided portions of their faculty handbooks addressing tenure.\nThe purpose of the study was to determine (a) what CCCU schools grant tenure, (b) why they grant tenure, (c) specific tenure policies and practices, (d) what CCCU schools do not grant tenure, (e) why they do not grant tenure, (f) retention policies used in place of tenure, and (g) how CCCU schools' tenure policies compare with the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) guidelines.\nThe data suggests that (a) the majority of CCCU schools (68%) grant tenure, (b) these schools represent nearly all religious affiliations within the CCCU, and (c) they are large in relation to CCCU schools that do not grant tenure. The predominant reasons given for granting tenure are protection of academic freedom, mutual commitment by institution and faculty, and recruiting\/retaining quality faculty. The schools grant tenure based on teaching, scholarship, service, and the integration of faith and learning. Tenure success rates seem high.\nThirty-two percent of the CCCU colleges and universities do not grant tenure. These schools are small in relation to CCCU schools that grant tenure. They represent nearly all religious affiliations within the CCCU. The predominant reason given for not granting tenure is tradition\/institutional values. The majority of these schools use a graduated contract system while some use an eventual continuous contract system.\nThe CCCU member schools' tenure policies are largely consistent with AAUP guidelines.","","","","Problem . Few studies have focused on effective professional development programs that enhance faith-learning implementation in the Christian higher education classroom, and little has been documented about what integration of faith and learning actually looks or sounds like in Christian higher education classrooms.\n\nPurpose . This study had four purposes: (1) to describe the training processes used for preparing teachers in Christian higher education for implementing IFL in the classroom; (2) to compare these methodologies with Jesus' training methodologies and research-based professional development programs; (3) to understand how teachers in Christian higher education classrooms defined IFL; and (4) to identify and document some exemplary practices of faith and learning integration in Christian higher education classrooms.\n\nMethodology . This study used a descriptive, qualitative case study method comprising purposive sampling techniques; participant observation; semi-structured, in-depth interviews; surveys; observation of three Faith and Learning Seminars, and observation of six teachers from the three Christian colleges.\n\nFindings and conclusions . A triangulation of this data revealed common themes. First, the training processes employed at the Faith and Learning Seminars seemed to emphasize more the publication of IFL (position) papers than classroom implementation. These training processes lacked some essential components which Jesus, the Master Teacher\/Trainer, used to train His disciples--components which research has found to facilitate transfer of skills to the workplace, enhance effectiveness, impact student performance, and help implementors deal with their personal concerns about the new knowledge.\n\nSecond, there was no single definition of IFL. Definitions of IFL fell into three classifications: intellectual (thinking Christianly and seeking the mind of God, and seeking balance between the spiritual and the secular), lifestyle, and discipleship\/relationship. However, most seminar participants defined IFL intellectually.\n\nThird, many of the IFL practices in the Christian higher education classrooms seemed to be based on teacher talk and did not occur at the level of student learning. This study revealed that the most obvious reason for this was that both the teachers and their trainers in IFL seemed to lack the training on how to model or provide practical suggestions on how to implement IFL in the classroom. Pedagogy is a crucial component for classroom implementation of IFL.","This article responds to the challenge to \u2018unpack\u2019 the \u2018slogan\u2019 of faith\/learning integration. It discusses three ways by which the topic may be approached in academic discourse. These include institution building, the deconstruction of dichotomies and dualities, and the integration of creed and deed. While our discussion in regards to institution building and the integration of creed and deed constitutes an extension of current constructs, we advance the notion of the deconstruction of dichotomies and dualities as a new approach to the faith\/learning integration theme.","James Tunstead Burtchaell, who has extensive experience in American higher education as both a teacher and an administrator, provides case studies of seventeen prominent colleges and universities with diverse ecclesial origins - Congregational, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, Catholic, and Evangelical. Using published and archival sources as well as firsthand interaction with each institution he covers, Burtchaell narrates how each school's religious identity eventually became first uncomfortable and then expendable, and he analyzes the processes that eroded the bonds between school and church.","This book demonstrates that, despite much evidence to the contrary, there are still Christian colleges and universities of high academic quality that have also kept their religious heritages publicly relevant. Respected scholar Robert Benne explores how six schools from six different religious traditions (Calvin College, Wheaton College, St. Olaf College, Valparaiso University, Baylor University, and the University of Notre Dame) have maintained \"quality with soul\". These constructive case studies examine the vision, ethos, and personnel policies of each school, showing how 'and why' its religious foundation remains strong.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Much of the current library literature assumes that professional library service is necessarily neutral-detached from the librarian's philosophical or religious views. By contrast, contributors to this collection assert that librarianship is best practiced as an outworking of spiritual conviction. Accordingly, they discuss principles for integrating Christian faith and librarianship within various contexts, and reflect on professional issues from biblical and theological perspectives. This text will prove beneficial to Christians working in all types of libraries, whether religious or secular. This compilation of 16 essays is divided into two main parts, the first on theory and the second on practice. The first part includes chapters such as A Rationale for Integrating Christian Faith and Librarianship, The Master We Serve: The Call of the Christian Librarian to the Secular Workplace; and The Impact of the Christian Faith on Library Service. Chapters in the second part include Library Encounters Culture, A Christian Approach to Intellectual Freedom in Libraries and Keeping Sunday Special in the Contemporary Workplace Culture. Contributors include William Fraher Abernathy, Rod Badams, Donald G. Davis, Jr., John Allen Delivuk, Kenneth D. Gill, Graham Hedges, D. Elizabeth Irish, James R. Johnson, Roger W.

Trotti, John Mark Tucker and Geoff Warren.","","","","This literature review presents an overview of Christian higher education in the United States with particular attention to philosophical trends and their influence on institutions of Christian origin. This literature review is situated in the context of the discussion of the need, or lack thereof, for helping students integrate their faith with the learning they acquire in colleges and universities.","","","","This magisterial book is an analysis of the course of Western intellectual history between A.D. 400 and 1400. The book is arranged in two parts: the first surveys the comparative modes of thought and varying success of Byzantine, Latin-Christian, and Muslim cultures, and the second takes the reader from the eleventh-century revival of learning to the high Middle Ages and beyond, the period in which the vibrancy of Western intellectual culture enabled it to stamp its imprint well beyond the frontiers of Christendom.Marcia Colish argues that the foundations of the Western intellectual tradition were laid in the Middle Ages and not, as is commonly held, in the Judeo-Christian or classical periods. She contends that Western medieval thinkers produced a set of tolerances, tastes, concerns, and sensibilities that made the Middle Ages unlike other chapters of the Western intellectual experience. She provides astute descriptions of the vernacular and oral culture of each country of Europe; explores the nature of medieval culture and its transmission; profiles seminal thinkers (Augustine, Anselm, Gregory the Great, Aquinas, Ockham); studies heresy from Manichaeism to Huss and Wycliffe; and investigates the influence of Arab and Jewish writing on scholasticism and the resurrection of Greek studies. Colish concludes with an assessment of the modes of medieval thought that ended with the period and those that remained as bases for later ages of European intellectual history.This book inaugurates an important new series that provides a chronological account of intellectual life and the development of ideas in Western Europe from the medieval period to the present.","","","","The problem of evangelicalism is the question of why it has remained such a popular, potent force in American life throughout the twentieth century. This study traces the vitality of evangelicalism back to the structure and ethos of fundamentalist institutions by examining Wheaton College--the movement's most prominent liberal arts college and the hub of a large network of other independent, special purpose religious organizations.\nWheaton was very much a two-cultures institution, embodying characteristics of and mediating between a popular religious movement and the secular world of higher education. The college's history between 1919 and 1965 shows that the nature of fundamentalists' institutional networks required a good deal of mutual cooperation. It also shows that the movement was quite at home with the forms and ideas of American popular culture. In Wheaton's case, the college adopted the culture's prevailing ideas about liberal arts education nearly whole cloth--purposes, structure, curriculum, accreditation, admissions, student culture, and even a good measure of faculty culture--without yielding a fraction of its full-bodied, pre-modern supernaturalism. This suggests that fundamentalism's enduring popular success stems not from any tendency to separate itself from its host culture, nor from any tendency to resist change, but from the movement's ready willingness to adapt its pre-modern supernaturalistic Christianity to the shifting forms of modern popular culture.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This essay, utilizing the \u201ckaleidoscope\u201d image of historian Timothy Smith, reflects on issues affecting evangelical identity and boundaries in the major professional association for Christian higher education, the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU). Since the CCCU was birthed by a smaller organization, the Christian College Consortium, attention is given to how evangelical boundaries were understood by the parent group. The paper then shows how the CCCU stretched those boundaries in several directions as membership grew. Over a period of 25-plus years, the CCCU cultivated a marked denominational pluralism along with a cooperative evangelical ecumenism. This essay explores these developments in terms of membership criteria including affiliate status, doctrinal standards, the emphasis on the integration of faith and learning, and official statements and limitations of the CCCU's approach to evangelical boundaries, suggesting that the CCCU look at developing more definitive doctrinal anchors for its mission statement and membership criteria.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","\"The humanities disciplines don't seem to be dying out, but they do feel dislocated.

In part 1, Cosgrove explores the relationship between faith and learning and how an underlying worldview can influence one's beliefs. Part 2 describes and tests five major worldviews competing with Christian theism, including naturalism, secular humanism, atheistic existentialism, pantheism, and the New Age movement. The last part probes the Christian worldview in more detail by analyzing the challenges it faces and how it is lived out day-to-day. An educator on the college campus for thirty years, Cosgrove testifies to how well the Christian worldview relates with the current needs and ideas in American culture. Through Foundations of Christian Thought, high school and college students will begin to see how the Christian worldview is relevant to what they are studying in the classroom and the decisions they make. Readers in the workforce and elsewhere will learn to relate their faith to modern worldviews in our culture.","","","This study explores the emergence and fulfillment of a saga at Wheaton College, the most academically renowned and selective of the evangelical Christian colleges. Burton Clark identified a powerful, affective commitment by members to their organization as a key to distinctiveness at three liberal arts colleges: Swarthmore, Antioch, and Reed. How do sagas emerge and become fulfilled in institutions embracing a conservative, biblical worldview?\nData were collected from three schools (Wheaton, Seattle Pacific and Westmont). The Wheaton case alone was written up because of the powerful saga that prevailed at that college. A combination of data collection strategies were used: participant observation, archival research, and interviews. The case study method combines a historical approach with the data gathered on site for a rich overview of Wheaton College from its founding in 1860 to the 1980's.\nWheaton's history is a vibrant and dynamic account of an institution with a distinct purpose and a strong sense of destiny. From the outset, Wheaton College became identified as an institution willing to stand alone, to pursue a course consistent with the theologically orthodox principles to which the school was initially dedicated. The founder and his son laid the foundations of a mission and a sense of purpose for the College which galvanized faculty, trustees, students and alumni into a faithful and committed group of followers. This institutional cohesion and mission, reinforced by a strong association with the fundamentalist movement in the early decades of the twentieth century, consolidated the College's orthodox evangelical Christian identity for which it is known today.\nThe confrontations of the late 1960's that swept American college campuses, the questioning of authority driving many of the protests, and the quest for new direction, purpose and meaning in higher education did not leave Wheaton unaffected. By 1967, the unity of purpose of a previous era had given way to a fragile synthesis of the traditional values challenged by a growing desire among faculty in particular for recognition in the greater academic community. Initial resistance to the values of secular academia has, in recent years, given way to an increasing desire, commensurate with the changing values and priorities of today's evangelicals, to belong and be recognized as a bona fide liberal arts college on a par with Oberlin and Amherst.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Problem. Research is lacking on the many ways the integration of faith and learning is accomplished by teachers. The purpose of this study was to develop a model of the process by which teachers integrate faith and learning in the formal curriculum. The model was validated by investigating to what extent the integration of faith and learning was deliberately accomplished by teachers in six Seventh-day Adventist secondary schools located in three South American countries.\nMethod. A multi-method approach involving questionnaire, interviews, and document analysis was used in order to study the process teachers experience in implementing integration of faith and learning in their classes. Triangulation occurred as observation from one source was cross-validated with observation from other sources.\nResults. The findings of this study support the notion of a stage model of implementation in which teachers find themselves in a continuum from no-interest, no-use, to dynamic collaboration.\nConclusions. (1) Teachers integrate faith in the formal curriculum in different stages of implementation. (2) Factors such as theoretical knowledge of integration of faith and learning, its implementation strategies, interest, concerns, and difficulty of the subject influence the degree of teacher implementation. (3) Student involvement in the integration of faith and learning process is an essential but frequently overlooked ingredient in the implementation process. (4) Support from the school administration and the parochial educational system provide direction and incentive for teacher implementation. (5) National, social, and cultural forces, along with the religious background of students and teachers, all directly or indirectly influence teacher implementation.","Although the mission statements of most member schools of the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities include a focus on the importance of the integration of faith and learning, the rhetoric often far outweighs the reality. An examination of the history of this concept, which is inexorably entwined with the history of American higher education in general, reveals its complexity and ambiguity. A plethora of authors have addressed the issue from a number of perspectives---philosophical, theological, theoretical, denominational, and practical. Very few, however, have described the personal experiences of professors in evangelical Christian liberal arts colleges and universities. The purpose of this study was to create a portrait of professors at Wheaton College, an evangelical liberal arts college, who exemplify the integration of faith and learning, in order to better understand such integration. Using portraiture, a qualitative research methodology developed by Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot that relies primarily upon in-depth interviews, the researcher provided a meaningful interpretive narrative that drew upon the voices, authority, and wisdom of these exemplary professors. Themes that emerged from the analysis of interview transcripts, observation field notes, and documents written by seven professors at Wheaton College were identified and analyzed. Implications for the administration and faculty of Christian liberal arts institutions were discussed, and suggestions for future research were made.","","","","","","","","","",""],"parentItem":["","H4C5HI6K","H4C5HI6K","H4C5HI6K","H4C5HI6K","H4C5HI6K","H4C5HI6K","H4C5HI6K","","99N7FZ54","","","F4EC7PQ9","","VHN2FWHC","","","GED2KEEI","","","HXFJ6IU4","HXFJ6IU4","","3QWI2HEQ","KSJBPGB3","4VPP96VZ","SDWWFT3P","","","","","","","FU6G3KI3","","","E7J3DKJN","","W9FKWR9D","XE5QWXC9","","","","","F994NR95","M2XE65D7","F994NR95","8QIFH3UE","9MFM78J5","VHDP7VCP","","","","","","","ZQTDN5TF","","57PPDGVJ","FV5E2K39","","","","ZIXJ998Z","","","","JIFS8QRQ","","6ZBK4K9F","X5TSQIQD","","MGP3GJ72","","","","","","","","","","","ANBZXFB4","UXVFPTUN","WENFVXIQ","F4D6NFDF","UN7XAHUK","KR79IZGS","3JBA4BDF","3KRJJDGV","","","","Q8PMKS4G","7ZMTGF6F","RVNVSPXI","EEDC9PT7","","JR4TZWBZ","","","4CWKVIUM","","X2THFCRU","","","","","X2VKKFDX","","VQSUKTJ9","ET777KHG","","58MJJV8J","","","D9MPGAK6","J72MDHFP","","","","","2M9MESH3","FHCIGIKE","","","","W5FGQUZ8","","","","WZHCTIVQ","GKTE3EGD","","","ZT2B5M3Z","8MAEUKPS","","XZ8PJI3Q","","J6A27BEC","","FH6GRIJN","","","","","","","DUFDWHC5","XA5ATGF9","","","TUQTUXCB","","K6XPK4IB","","","","52SVQM7U","IHB6F45B","JISRTAC9","","","","","","","","","","","EPV7I7IF","","","S74R4R9R","","JMDJZD3V","47FH3DN7","47FH3DN7","47FH3DN7","","47FH3DN7","","KT2MEKXI","KT2MEKXI","","","","","","","","","","","WJ6BEC34","DZG2MGMP","DZG2MGMP","","7RU54IG4","7RU54IG4","7RU54IG4","8GJVKQ4F","8GJVKQ4F","","","H7Q523BB","","F9KIVRRZ","","","7VN7UG2K","5JJS2593","9BWBZQ9Z","","9CAN7DW9","","MS8HVIWN","FA3GVNZ9","","I8RHR978","IH9UBXX9","","","3X39GWWC","","","KHM6M9MA","","","AWF3558T","","","","","","","","","SF6F4A8J","W46MZWMB","SF6F4A8J","W46MZWMB","BUIT85SJ","UUTNNUSC","HP5U6S73","3Z5SVQN8","I465KZAE","","","","","MSNWE9VI","8SSM6WVN","PCWCJHUT","","","A8VQFT8U","KT2MEKXI","","HDB37QME","6RTH3Q26","","","","","","BI8IIIWP","W7U5N8EB","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","QQC5XAI2","","H5QDBGXR","ERG5DF69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","H8MM84AW","","","BFF63DZT","","7G8G3MDZ","SKVVZDJS","","7IPVFKRF","PNKCWZQ3","","","N4CZ5RJ3","","","BJ6B74MU","","83G2XTQZ","","","","J9NB38KE","XUG4TIFR","47FH3DN7","","V8UF7DFV","ARS35D29","72QF2UDW","ZZFZZFZI","","JMCHS37A","","SDQ2FT88","4NQTK5XT","","","","ACZK8IT9","","","","BF94Q5ND","","9BU5BPH3","T9FUK4UD","S2JKI4XS","","","AXMD7BCX","","3SEU3KAB","3SEU3KAB","","VR77VJN2","","","6RH8ZR7W","6U8ZKHBC","36B8A922","INUDJ4AK","","EHZH9KB5","","IATT8HRZ","","","MXST7687","","","2MRJWR7U","","","","","","","","","","","","","WHVDEZEJ","8WV48AV4","","WG285AEK","","","","","","","","KVDB3TTC","GEEGT5HZ","6VV7GFRQ","","99N7FZ54","R5X2S6IE","","BF94Q5ND","","TTAUVSM4","WDNZDQAS","RCVMTC2B","WN4PQUQP","","R27HDXDQ","9ICTUTJ4","","4ZJB5AZ5","AQAUXSPE","","","2H7HAEWQ","KRHUXRTG","ZGDTQAEV","XGMMSD3Z","FR9CV8HJ","","","","","4539HE49","VR99PCAZ","P8VHX4CU","","","","","7N634T9Z","7N634T9Z","URUTW7GX","URUTW7GX","K65DBKB6","4RS96DQB","V59MJQZN","5E7J3IFR","","V59MJQZN","UZDE6ATQ","BGR75H33","45ZZ2SIJ","FHKFAHE8","XZXKC89W","XZXKC89W","NBRW9T82","NTB3G43G","EPDWDVPV","3N6RZIRU","P5PSV6HS","P5PSV6HS","P5PSV6HS","392ZXXFG","NTBZK5IH","6W9TW7TP","H7TUP4KD","JPTM7ZH8","DZG2MGMP","97HN2D4X","97HN2D4X","NIESKSK2","","4CAWTHNZ","9F3M6J5E","9F3M6J5E","","7N634T9Z","6VV7GFRQ","6U8ZKHBC","","EPDWDVPV","HV8T6WB3","HV8T6WB3","","NTB3G43G","42EABQ36","NUGR6GT3","392ZXXFG","V6SKPS9M","MJET5Q7H","5DMMWMN8","97HN2D4X","U8JGEU3B","","8GJVKQ4F","KQF23B7V","KQF23B7V","","","VTPN6NTF","4JFX774H","XBFE8SKH","3FGJB877","5SEAB4ZA","SVMPC9DX","TGW45G5C","SFJ22K3D","AS3CRVRI","BGR75H33","","","","","","","W5K275RK","S3FBCEHA","","","","","","RJ2GMAF9","","MMUX4WJ3","H4C5HI6K","TQ95N2PM","","H7TUP4KD","D796WUH9","","D796WUH9","UVNT4I38","UVNT4I38","GWCQ8JFA","IUFXZ3MG","KQ8E43FR","","H4C5HI6K","6NNXGRIX","S4E324V9","9W63ENXS","XGFPXES2","H4C5HI6K","S4E324V9","9W63ENXS","XGFPXES2","6NNXGRIX","","","XUZCXFAI","JE8TMAWX","JE8TMAWX","JPTM7ZH8","","UZDE6ATQ","G3PJFJ5E","G3PJFJ5E","NJ2UMAXR","8PMXA5ET"]}

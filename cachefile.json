essay appeared in Wheaton's \"New Faculty Handbook.\" The Handbook was edited by Alan Jacobs, who was serving at the time as coordinator of the faith and learning program. Most of the essay content draws on what Hamilton had published earlier in the 90s, including his Notre Dame dissertation\n\nThe essay details Wheaton's move out of the anti-modernist, fundamentalist camp into \"the promised land of interdenominational evangelicalism\" in the 1950s. Hamilton then charts the ways in which the college sought to \"maintain its dual citizenship in the evangelical world and the world of [secular] higher education.\" It did so by means of what he calls the \"four models,\" one of which is \"the integration of faith and learning\" model. \n\nLaying aside his historian's cap, Hamilton concludes with his personal opinion that Wheaton has missed numerous opportunities to be a leader in the area of faith-learning integration because of fear-based decision making:  \"Fear [among others] that academic excellence will lead to apostasy. And feeding all these, the supreme fear that I\u2019ve not yet named\u2014that deviation from the constituency\u2019s beliefs and values will threaten the survival of the college.\"","This book features nine essays exploring shifting relations between Christianity and secular rationality. Introduced by editor Bloechl (Boston College), the essays are written by prominent American philosophers and theologians working in the Catholic tradition. Their orientation is primarily Continental rather than Anglo-American. The book began as a set of seminar papers, and the finished essays have the feel of a sustained conversation, even though the contributors do not explicitly engage each other. The discussion focuses on ways that changing religious and secular conceptions of reason and faith challenge, complement, threaten, and depend on one another. Some of the essays are more thematic than historical. However, their arc is broadly historical--from foundations in 12th- and 13th-century thinkers through modern development of robust and confident secular reason (especially in the figure of Kant) to postmodern (and postsecular) themes and figures such as John Milbank, Jean-Luc Marion, and Jurgen Habermas and his engagement with Pope Benedict XVI. The essays are deeply conversant with a broad range of scholarly literature and will be of interest to serious students and scholars. (From the Introduction)","","","","Theological education has always been vital to the Church\u2019s life and mission; yet today it is in crisis, lacking focus, direction, but also resources and even students. In the early Church, there is no doubt that to lead worship one had to be able to read and interpret the Bible. In order to lead, it was necessary to know at least something about the history of Israel and the work of God in the Gospels, and interpret that history, making it relevant to daily living. Quickly the Church developed schools for its teachers, whether lay or clergy. A catechetical system was organized through which candidates prepared for baptism were given a basic form of theological education. Hence to be a Christian meant persons knew what and why they believed. But over the years, theological education has come to mean education for clergy and church professionals. It has drifted, seeking new moorings.","This book details major developments in the history of Christian education. It offers a context for understanding present-day educational efforts among Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Orthodox Christians. The history presents the major thinkers and practitioners who have influenced how Christians transmit their faith to both children and adults. It also shows how major historical events and intellectual movements have impacted the shape and content of Christian education.","","What does it mean to be a human being made in the image of God? In this book Nonna Verna Harrison, a respected specialist in early Eastern Christianity, offers a fresh approach to theological anthropology by revealing the thought of leading early church theologians concerning what it means to be human. Throughout the ages Christians have believed that the image of God in which we are created is at the core of who we are as humans. Theologians and spiritual writers have found the divine image in many different aspects of human identity. Drawing on the wisdom of the desert mothers and fathers and the heritage of Eastern Christianity, Harrison makes the case that the divine image can be seen in not just one or two aspects of human identity but in all of them. Each chapter explores a different facet of the divine image and likeness and maps out a path that can lead toward wholeness and holiness. Harrison challenges the popularized negative view of human nature as inherently bad by proposing an alternative grounded in early Greek Christian sources. God's Many-Splendored Image brings Greek patristic theology to students in a readable fashion and will work well in theology, patristics, ministry, missions, and anthropology courses. [from the book's Foreword]","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Larsen examines the lives and thought of six British anthropologists and the varying conclusions they reached regarding the relationship between religious faith and their scholarship.","Former Wheaton Provost, Stanton Jones,  responds to Peter Conn's blog article posted less than week earlier in which he includes Wheaton in the ranks of religious fundamentalists waging against science, and that \"Wheaton makes a mockery of whatever academic and intellectual standards the process of accreditation is supposed to uphold.\"","","","","If the secular university by definition is non-sectarian or non-denominational, then how can it accommodate a discipline like Christian theology?? Doesn\u2019t the traditional goal of theological study, which is to attain knowledge of the divine, fundamentally conflict with the main goal of secular academic study, which is to attain knowledge about ourselves and the world in which we live?? So why should theology be admitted, or even care about being admitted, into secular academic life? And even if theology were admitted, what contribution to secular academic life could it make?  Working from a Christian philosophical and theological perspective but also engaging a wide range of theologians, philosophers, and religious studies scholars, Christian Theology and the Secular University takes on these questions, arguing that Christian theology does belong in the secular university because it provides distinct resources that the secular university needs if it is going to fulfill what should be its main epistemic and educative ends.? This book offers a fresh and unique perspective to scholars working in the disciplines of theology, philosophy, and religious studies, and to those in other academic disciplines who are interested in thinking critically and creatively about the place and nature of theological study within the secular university.","Over the last two decades, the American academy has engaged in a wide-ranging discourse on faith and learning, religion and higher education, and Christianity and the academy. Eastern Orthodox Christians, however, have rarely participated in these conversations. The contributors to this volume aim to reverse this trend by offering original insights from Orthodox Christian perspectives into the ongoing discussion about religion, higher education, and faith and learning in the United States. The book is divided into two parts. Essays in the first part explore the historical experiences and theological traditions that inform (and sometimes explain) Orthodox approaches to the topic of religion and higher education\u2014in ways that often set them apart from their Protestant and Roman Catholic counterparts. Those in the second part problematize and reflect on Orthodox thought and practice from diverse disciplinary contexts in contemporary higher education. The contributors to this volume offer provocative insights into philosophical questions about the relevance and application of Orthodox ideas in the religious and secular academy, as well as cross-disciplinary treatments of Orthodoxy as an identity marker, pedagogical framework, and teaching and research subject. \"Seldom have so many scholars representing such a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities (even the hard sciences) been brought together to address the important issue of faith and learning through the prism of various aspects of the Eastern Orthodox tradition. The fact that all but one of these contributors are themselves Orthodox Christian scholars provides ample proof that most likely representatives of Orthodox Christianity will be active participants in the ongoing debate addressing the crucial question of faith and the academy, or Athens and Jerusalem, to borrow Tertullian's much abused epigrammatic description of the phenomenon. Eastern Orthodox Christianity and American Higher Education will be useful to the growing number of classes on Eastern Orthodox history and culture taught in American colleges and universities.\" \u2014Theofanis G. Stavrou, University of Minnesota","","In the modern university, religion is often taken to school--primarily in the sense of being critiqued, disciplined, and domesticated. In this provocative book, Stephen Webb steps into the middle of current controversies about the place of religion in secular high schools and colleges. Speaking explicitly as a Christian theologian, but also as one who accepts the reality of religious pluralism, Webb argues that the teaching of religion is itself a religious activity, that teachers of religion should not disguise their own faiths in the classroom, and that high schools and universities should allow more--not less--space for religious voices.","","","The scholastic debate about use and interpretation of the phrase \u201cfaith-learning integration\u201d has spanned over fifty years. Glanzer (2008) proposed that this phrase be discarded and that scholars adopt the terminology of \"creation and redemption of scholarship.\u201d This concept is not new to Christian dialogue: it can be found in the writings of St. Augustine. However, there needs to be further clarification of Glanzer\u2019s language in order to make it accessible to people of all faiths, backgrounds, and education levels. This paper will attempt to support both Glanzer\u2019s proposal and a new direction for the discussion and encourage educators to adopt this new language as faith-based scholars.\n[Author-supplied abstract]","Calvin professor and philosopher, James Smith, in the book Desiring the Kingdom, offers his critique of modern day evangelical Christian higher education. Part of the problem lies in its prevailing anthropology, which remains bound by an overly rationalistic view of human nature, and reflects the continued influence of Enlightenment thinkers such as Descarte and Kant. The reality is, Smith argues, we live and move and have our being according to not what we think or believe, but what we desire, and especially the desires rooted in our vision of the good life, and of human flourishing.","\"This book explores the role that reflective Christian faith can play in unifying the intellectual life of the university,\" and specifically the church-related universities and colleges.

It remains a model of Christian liberal education.","","","","According to Fr. John Behr (St. Vladimir Seminary) St. Gregory Nazianzen's oration, On St. Basil the Great, Bishop of Caesarea, contains the most powerful apolegetic in early Christianity for the value and utility of learning for the Christian. Specifically, Gregory argues that from the study of secular literature we have received \u201cthe principles of inquiry and contemplation,\u201d theoria, that deeper level of understanding that comes after we understand the words on the page, grammar, which helps to see why grammar, rhetoric and logic formed the foundation - trivuum - of a \u201cclassical education.\u201d","Physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-1879) is considered by many to have been as important\nto physics as Newton and Einstein, especially for his work on electricity and magnetism\nand for being the first director of the Cavendish Laboratory. His technical achievements are\nsignificant, but he also offers us a model of the qualities of physics education in a Christian\nliberal arts environment. This work explores his writings and discusses some of his various\nexperiences, such as his broad education at the University of Edinburgh and participation\nin elite intellectual discussion societies, which developed and demonstrated his ability to\nthink broadly. In some instances, he shared about his faith in God and how it informed his\nperspectives. Furthermore, in the inaugural lectures he gave for the three professorships he\nheld over his lifetime, he shared his views on the role that the study of physics can play in\npersonal formation. This paper suggests that his personal and professional examples may be\ncritical qualities to be emulated in today's Christian liberal arts physics programs, as higher\neducation undergoes significant transition.","","Certainly by the title a book to reckon with if you're interested in how early Church writers wrestled with faith and learning issues. According to one reviewer,  Ellspermann's basic thesis--that the attitude of the Fathers toward pagan learning, generally, was negative  at first but becomes increasingly sympathetic--had already been established by other scholars, and thus represented \"a safe conclusion.\" That said, it remains a helpful introduction to the topic in spite of it not being particularly well written. The author includes summaries of each chapter, which annoys the specialists apparently, but is helpful for the rest of us. In once such summary the author states that, by the time the Latin apologists, Minucius Felix and Tertullian, come on the scene (early 3rd century), the Greek fathers had largely worked out the issue of accommodation as it relates to pagan learning. And by the mid-3rd century most Christian writers embraced the usefulness of pagan literature and learning for Christians, though with a few exceptions such as Tertullian and Aristides the Athenian. Speaking of Tertullian, one so often \"maligned in that which has to do with issues of faith and reason,\" check out Justo Gonzalez's article <a href=\"http:\/\/ezproxy.wheaton.edu\/login?url=http:\/\/search.ebscohost.com\/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rfh&AN=ATLA0000739460&site=ehost-live\">Athens and Jerusalem Revisited: Reason and Authority in Tertullian<\/a>.","This is a collection of Breen's writings.

(166)","","Gregory Nazianzus and Basil of Ceasarea are the likely compilers of this original Philokalia, a clear indication of the high regard that Origen enjoyed among the great Greek fathers of the church, and in spite of the fact that \"Origenism\" would be condemned in the sixth century. Churches in Origen's time often took the form of a philosophical school as was the case with him, and an extent letter from one of his disciples gives us a good sense of how these schools operated, and just how secular learning served to prepare one for theological studies. As Origen taught, our approach to secular learning (esp. literature and philosophy) should be viewed as \"plundering the Egyptians\" just as the Isrealites did in the Exodus.","","","Collection of essays that includes:\nBad habits and bad company: education and evil in the Confessions, by K Paffenroth.

Such lengthy conversations are complicated by variations in nomenclature, attitudes, and theological assumptions. This paper attempts to clarify portions of this historical discussions by focusing on how a given thinker weighs and balances four interrelated doctrinal issues: the unity of truth, the two sources of knowledge, the noetic effects of sin, and goodness of creation. It is suggested that thinkers commonly adopt one of five \"integrative\" postures: butcher, baker, candlestick maker, philosopher, or prophet. Lessons are drawn from this history and applied to some of the issues that face the academy today.","","This article argues that a coherent and inspired general education program, infused with a deliberate vision of the liberal arts, is crucial to the flourishing of Christian higher education. This article begins by describing the context and status of general education, emphasizing how this element of the educational program falls short in embodying a distinctive mission of Christian higher education. This article then contends that a vibrant vision of general education will be grounded in particular aspects of a liberal arts education that fulfill crucial outcomes of the Christian university, specifically cultivating the formal virtues and fostering meaning and purpose. The article concludes with recommendations for advancing the aims of general education within Christian higher education, highlighting the benefits of a common curriculum and intentional faculty development.","This article does not attempt to address the many and varied changes currently facing Christian higher education, but seeks to provide a framework for thinking about the future that is grounded in the church's heritage and tradition. Believing that the secular culture is indifferent to the Christian faith and that the Christ world tends to be confused about its heritage and beliefs, the article proposes that the Christian tradition, informed by the Nicene Creed, offers a hopeful way forward. At the heart of Christian higher education is a calling to prepare a new generation of Christians to think Christianly, to engage the culture and the academy, to serve society, and to renew connections with the church and its mission. Contending that limiting Christ-centeredness to the sphere of personal piety or activism is minimalistic and inadequate, the article also suggests that any attempt to envision a faithful Christian higher education for the future that is not tightly tethered to the great Christian tradition will likely result in an education model that lacks a compass. The uniting of the Christian tradition with learning is proposed as the pathway forward for understanding the essence of Christian higher education. In doing so, this article offers a pathway that focuses on the central and foundational commitments needed to sustain a faithful future for Christian higher education.","This article presents a discussion of the gender imbalance in senior-level leadership roles within the U.S. member institutions of the Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU), highlighting data across the last two decades. The underrepresentation of women in this sector is placed within a theological context and is compared with other sectors of U.S. higher education. Insights from the secular literature provide an introductory context for the article's presentation of the data. Although the CCCU member institutions collectively serve a student body that is 60% female, a 2015 analysis of individuals holding \u201cvice president\u201d or higher titles (e.g., senior vice president, executive vice president) revealed that women held fewer than 30% of those employed in any particular leadership role (e.g., chief academic officer) and only slightly over 20% of all senior leadership roles. Notably, when a national study compared the leadership composition of 1,481 evangelical non-profit organizations with their secular counterparts, the representation of women on boards and senior leadership teams was found to be about half of that found in the secular nonprofits (Reynolds, 2014). Although Christian colleges and universities have an opportunity to set the standard within higher education for identifying, encouraging, and deploying the gifts of individuals across racial and gender lines, a variety of environmental and internalized barriers hinder the affirmation and development of women's leadership identity and advancement. Five recommended action steps conclude the article, with a call to reimagine Christian higher education as being places of learning characterized by fully affirming and developing the potential of all within their span of care.","Leaders of evangelical Christian colleges must navigate a challenging environment shaped by public concern about college costs and educational quality, federal inclinations toward increased regulation, and lingering fallout from the Great Recession. Proceeding from the premise that empirical analysis empowers institutional actors to lead well in uncertain times, this article examines four key areas\u2014access, affordability, student outcomes, and financial sustainability\u2014using publicly available data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). Results for the evangelical segment and the wider private nondoctoral sector of American higher education are compared, and areas of relative strength and weakness are considered. To facilitate benchmarking by institutional research professionals, the article's appendix presents national longitudinal norms for both the evangelical segment and the private nondoctoral sector.","An introduction to the journal is presented which discusses articles on topics including the underrepresentation of women in positional leadership, the campus spiritual climate for LGBTQ students enrolled in Christian colleges, and the future of Christian higher education.","The focus of this article centers on three specific themes of disruption that are likely to affect the future of Christian higher education. The first theme examines the juxtaposition of faith-based institutional identity and its influence on a post-modern society. The second theme explores the disaggregation of traditional faculty functions and the impact on student learning and institutional effectiveness. The last theme addresses changing student demographics and the associated expectations of this post-traditional population. The magnitude and complexity of these themes requires dynamic and flexible leadership at the board, administrative, and faculty levels. This article distinguishes between disruptive and technical change, and identifies how each approach impacts the unique social concerns facing faith-based institutions today. The article concludes by proposing new models of institutional collaboration and innovative cultures of learning that will meet the pragmatic need for institutional efficiency and effectiveness.","The challenges facing higher education continue to mount. The shifting of the U.S. ethnic and racial demographics, the proliferation of advanced digital technologies and data, and the move from traditional degrees to continuous learning platforms have created an unstable environment to which Christian higher education must adapt in order to remain viable and ultimately to thrive. Courageous leadership is needed to confront a mindset of scarcity and address the resistance created by a tendency to protect the status quo. By challenging existing assumptions and searching for deep, adaptive solutions, Christian colleges and universities can maintain their unique distinctive as they reimagine their approach to education. This article ends with an imaginative look at the future of faith-based higher education.","","","","","","","","","In an era of rapid societal change, institutions of higher education are grappling with how to ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals are safe and supported on campus. Many challenges remain as LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff are subject to continued acts of discrimination and subtle microaggressions on a regular basis, according to national assessments of campus climate. When religion and spirituality are salient on campus or in the lived experiences of LGBTQ people, the complexities of faith as it intersects with sexuality and gender identity become increasingly apparent. In this essay, we portray current issues concerning the campus climate in an effort to imagine how Christian higher education leaders might respond in light of institutional aims to promote the spiritual growth of all members of their campus communities.","This study explored the predictors of success among 1,536 students of color from 12 Council for Christian Colleges & Universities (CCCU) member institutions. Student success was measured by examining students' intent to graduate along with the degree to which they were thriving intellectually, socially, and psychologically. The study utilized an instrument that included the Thriving Quotient (Schreiner, 2012), which measures students' psychosocial well-being, along with scales that assessed students' psychological sense of community, perceptions of institutional integrity and commitment to student welfare, spirituality, and satisfaction with student\u2013faculty interaction. The path model explained 35% of the variation in intent to graduate from their chosen CCCU institution among this sample of students of color. In addition to three factors that directly contributed to students' intent to graduate from their institutions\u2014institutional fit, thriving in their role as students, and students' perceptions of the institutions' commitment to their welfare\u2014the model revealed significant indirect contributors to the success of students of color. Recommendations based on these findings include creating campus environments, policies, and practices that consider the unique needs of all students, equipping faculty for inclusive pedagogy, and delivering on the implicit institutional promises made to students of color during the admissions process.","The future of Christian higher education is not certain, and faith-based institutions will need to continue to convince prospective students that the experiences they offer are worth the investment. What is missing in the discussion of what makes Christian higher education special is the transformational experience provided outside of the classroom. To this end, residential life and student affairs in Christian higher education is an area of untapped potential critical to the future of these campuses. When taking into account the lost role of service in the professoriate, the research on the impact of living on campus on student success, and the research on the importance of student-faculty interaction, it becomes evident that residential communities can be transformed into environments that offer an integrated, holistic education that is vital to the mission of Christian institutions.","","","","","","","","","What is Christian wisdom for living in the twenty-first century? Where is it to be found? How can it be learnt? In the midst of diverse religions and worldviews and the demands and complexities of our world, David Ford explores a Christian way of uniting love of wisdom with wisdom in love. Core elements are the 'discernment of cries', the love of God for God's sake, interpretation of scripture, and the shaping of desire in faith. Case studies deal with inter-faith wisdom among Jews, Christians and Muslims, universities as centres of wisdom as well as knowledge and know-how and the challenge of learning disabilities. Throughout, there is an attempt to do justice to the premodern, modern and postmodern while grappling with scripture, tradition and the cries of the world today. Ford opens up the rich resources of Christianity in engaging with the issues and urgencies of contemporary life.","","See chapter entitled \"Theological education in the Christian East, 1st to 6th centuries.\""],"parentItem":["","","F4EC7PQ9","","VHN2FWHC","","","GED2KEEI","","","HXFJ6IU4","HXFJ6IU4","","3QWI2HEQ","KSJBPGB3","4VPP96VZ","SDWWFT3P","ZXZMK3KV","","","","","","","","FU6G3KI3","EE78SX98","","","","E7J3DKJN","","W9FKWR9D","XE5QWXC9","","","","","F994NR95","M2XE65D7","F994NR95","8QIFH3UE","9MFM78J5","VHDP7VCP","","","","","","","","ZQTDN5TF","","57PPDGVJ","FV5E2K39","","","","ZIXJ998Z","","","","JIFS8QRQ","","6ZBK4K9F","X5TSQIQD","","MGP3GJ72","","","","","","","","","","","ANBZXFB4","UXVFPTUN","WENFVXIQ","F4D6NFDF","UN7XAHUK","KR79IZGS","3JBA4BDF","3KRJJDGV","","","","278XBAZ2","Q8PMKS4G","7ZMTGF6F","RVNVSPXI","EEDC9PT7","","JR4TZWBZ","","","4CWKVIUM",""]}
